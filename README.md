# Dev Sandbox
Web based sandbox for developers.

# Installation
As stated above, this isn't much more than a personal project. However, you're welcome to use the code here to start a portfolio of sorts.

Keep in mind this is setup to deploy to Heroku. You will need a .env file containing the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY variables.

I'll improve these installation details as I get time.
