# Helium Trader
Quantitative trading and research platform that couples as a portfolio on the frontend. The primary focus is the research and discussion of algorithmic trading strategies. This includes snapshotting backtest results and discussing parameter adjustments that could yield differing outcomes.

# About
To preface, this is not a point and click trading platform, but more of a sandbox for testing ideas and providing in-depth discussions. A place that allows an overview of skills and experiences in a simple single-page view.

Creative thought processes will be exercised publicly to aid in personal growth.

Hours spent with various tools will be updated and examined regularly to ensure best practices are being followed as experience is gained. The preference is to maximize the hours spent with good habits. 

# Installation
As stated above, this isn't much more than a personal project. However, you're welcome to use the code here to start a portfolio of sorts.

Keep in mind this is setup to deploy to Heroku. You will need a .env file containing the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY variables.

I'll improve these installation details as I get time.
